# React Natours
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It follows the [Advanced CSS and SASS](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) course on Udemy.com

I tweaked it and decided to use __React__ instead of pure html/css for more experience in UI component oriented work.

The page is hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
